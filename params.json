{"name":"Data Structures Portfolio","tagline":"A collection of Data Structures","body":"This project is a collection of data structures that I implemented, and use in my code semi-frequently. Early on in my CS adventure, I learned to avoid simply defaulting to an ArrayList of objects because it's easy. There are many cases where a carefully selected data structure can really increase efficiency and usability. Currently, the data structures that I have implemented include:\r\n\r\n* Binary Search Tree (BST)\r\n* Graph (unweighted)\r\n* Min/MaxHeap\r\n* Queue\r\n* Stack \r\n\r\nThis repository does not contain the custom data structures that I've used in individual projects. I did design a special data structure in my game Short Circuit, which was designed to allow towers to efficiently search out enemies based upon the distance between a given tower and all of the enemies that exist in the scene.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
